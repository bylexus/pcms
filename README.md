# pcms - The Programmer's Content Management System

I don't need a fancy, UI-driven CMS. I don't WANT a  UI, and I don't want a CMS that is in my way of doing things.
A CMS is too restrictive. I don't fear writing HTML and program code. I am a developer, at last, so I feel more
comfortable writing code in an editor than clicking in a UI.

This is the idea behind **pcms**, the Programmer's CMS: A clutter-free, code-centric, simple static site builder and server to deliver web sites. For people that love to code, and just want things done.

## Restart

This is a restart of the pcms project. I want to achieve a much simpler architecture:

* instead of parsing / serving content directly, I want to process it first:
* first, the content is processed and build to its final version (static content)
* then, optionally, it is delivered by a web server,
* optionally watching / rebuilding content on the fly.

### static building
The static build process should work as follows:

1. Walk the source directory tree
2. process each file by its type / extension:<br>
   - each type gets its processor, a code snippet that get the input file and generates an output file.
   - for example, HTML files are processed as a pogo template, so it is processed through the template engine
3. output the files to a destination folder

### Modes
The tool itself should support the following modes:

- build: build the site as described above
- serve: build and then watch for changes, while starting a web server to deliver
- serve-doc: serves the whole documentation as own static web site
- init: should generate a very basic demo page

### supported builders

- html: html templates, built using pogo2 and supporting a yaml-style header
- md: markdown templates, processed as pogo2 template and then converted to html
- scss: convert scss to css
- all the rest: copied 1:1 to the dest folder

## Features

* simple, fast, node-based page delivery system. No database needed, file-based only.
* serves HTML and markdown (which is rendered to HTML, too :-))
* Uses [pongo template engine, a django-like template engine](https://github.com/flosch/pongo2) for html/markdown files to create pages based on templates
* separates theme / layout from content
* Support for restricted pages using basic authentication

## Project Status

A first viable product is already available - All features to drive a full, real website are implemented. The first production site is already using
pcms: <https://alexi.ch/> is driven by the actual pcms version.

Still, this is an early stage, and many changes will come.

## Getting started

A getting started guide can be found in the documentation - see `doc/site/quickstart/index.md`, or check it out online: <https://pcms.alexi.ch/quickstart>

For the even more impatient:

```sh
# build PMCS (golang / go tools needed)
$ make build

# create a new site:
$ bin/pcms init path/to/site/

# serve it at localhost:3000
$ bin/pcms serve path/to/site/pcms-config.yaml

# read the doc at localhost:3000
$ make serve-doc
```

### TODOs, Requirements to the Go App

* [+] Write my own Webserver in GO
* [+] Logging: both request and application logging to files
* [+] read config from .env file or similar
* [+] supports html and markdown as templates
* [-] supports JSON data pages 
* [+] prepares the templates by using a template engine to apply the final output
* [+] supports themes - aka different base layouts 
* [+] supports the existing pcms structure: 
  * [+] a folder with page.json config and content represents a page
  * [+] sub-folders / files are served statically, or as sub-page
* [+] supports route/folder authentication (basic auth)
  * [-] add rate limiting for auth requests, to prevent brute-force attacks
* [+] builds page structure in memory
* [-] watches for changes, rebuilds the page structure on the fly without restart
* [-] page cache - cache templates as pre-rendered html files
* [-] configurable 404 page
* [-] support some real webserver features:
  * [-] Range header to seek / stream files
* [-] support all today's server config and page.json config, see https://pcms.alexi.ch/reference
* [-] cmd line sub-commands:
  * `init` to initialize a new pcms project  (_done_)
  * `serve` to start the web server (_done_)
  * `password` to create a new basic-auth credential password for a user config entry (_done_)
  * `reload` to signal a reload to a running process
  * `build` to build a static build of the web page
  * help for all commands
* [-] include documentation as built-in site (partially done - doc not upated)
* [-] include template site for generating a starter project
* [-] create a docker image with PCMS on-board (partially done, not yet published)
* [-] embed the `doc` folder into the binary, to run a doc page with only the binary.

### Migrating from pcms V1 (nodejs) to V2 (Golang)

Because V2 is a complete re-write, there are some breaking changes you need to consider and adapt:

* bcrypt password format: The used GO bcrypt library uses another algorithm than the previously used JavaScript libraray. So you have to re-generate all of your passwords. Sorry.

#### Migrating nunjucks templates from pcms V1

pcms-go uses [pongo](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/flosch/pongo2/v4@v4.0.2) instead of nunjucks as a template engine.
Therefore, and for the fact that I changed from nodejs to golang, there are several changes for the templates.

In general, the template engine is more or less compatible with the Django Template engine, see here: https://django.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.x/topics/templates.html

Because pcms-go uses pongo (django template language) instead of nunjucks, the templates need to be converted. The following
needs to be changed:

* Change typed comparison operators (`===`, `!==`) to standard ones (`==`, `!=`)
* Changes on the `page` object:
  * in general: All properties are `Uppercased`:
  * `page.title` ==> `page.Title`
  * `page.pageConfig` ==> `page.Metadata`
    * No default metadata anymore: `page.Metadata.enabled` is NOT true by default anymore, only if explicitely set
  * `page.childPages` ==> `page.Children`
  * `page.childPagesByRoute[routestr]` ==> `page.ChildPageByRoute(routeStr)`
* `route` ==> `page.Route`
* `rootPage`: see `page` (same object)
* Changes on the `site` object:
  * in general: All properties are `Uppercased`:
  * `site.title` ==> `site.Title`
* changes to special functions / filters:
  * `{% now %}` is now a Django Tag, but with a twist: its date format is that from the golang time format specification.
    So instead of `{% now "Y" %}` it is now `{% now "2006" %}`.
  * `{% for in in data | reverse %}` now becomes Â´{% for in in data reversed %}`
