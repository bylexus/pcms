# Requirements

In order to use and run pcms, you need to fullfil the following requirements:

* [ GO Lang >= 1.17 ]( https://go.dev/dl/ )
* The `pcms` binary (in fact, if I once deliver pre-built binaries, you don't even need GO)

... Really, that's it?? Well, yes! That's all you need. No database, no fancy infrastructure, no air plane. Oh, yes, and some idea for your content, but this is your problem ;-)
