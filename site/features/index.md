# Features

**Note**: pcms servers my own needs, so I just implement what is necessary for my projects. If something is missing, that means I just had no use for that feature.

## Implemented features

* simple, fast, node-based page delivery system.
* No database needed, file-based only.
* serves HTML and markdown (which is rendered to HTML, too :-))
* Uses [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks) for html/markdown files to create pages based on templates
* separates theme / layout from content

## Once-to-be-implemented features

* on-the-fly sass-to-css transformation
* static output generation of whole site
